My program includes a low-memory implementation of an averaging algorithm, and it uses that average to then calculate the outliers, or "least average". I was directly inspired by the "illuminated averages" of Jim Campbell, who did work similar to Shulman's in the early 2000s. He visited RPI, and that's where I first saw his averages of "The Wizard of Oz" and "Psycho", which he says he made with custom hardware, not software. (I'm not sure if Shulman was inspired by Campbell or if he just came up with the same idea.)
I now suspect that both artists averaged only selected images, rather than every single frame of the films in question. Or they calculate some kind of mode average, rather than a mean or median. Based on some of the averages I've done with my program, I think the mean average of every frame of the Wizard of Oz would be nothing but a grey rectangle. Median too, I think, but I'm less confident about that. I have that movie on Blu-ray, and at some point I'll get around to testing this theory.
